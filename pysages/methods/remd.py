"""
Temperature Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (T-REMD).

T-REMD alternately performs the following two steps:
  1) A number of replicas is simulated, simultaneously and independently, 
     each at a fixed temperature and for a certain number of MD steps;
  2) A pair of replicas at neighboring temperatures are exchanged with
     a probability given by the Metropolis criterion.
